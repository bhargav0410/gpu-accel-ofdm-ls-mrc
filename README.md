# gpu-accel-ofdm-ls-mrc
GPU and CPU codes for implementing OFDM Least Squares channel estimation and demodulation. Tested and implemented on ORBIT Testbed.

This repo consists of all files used for implementation of Least Sqaures channel estimation and Maximal Ratio Combining based demodulation for OFDM symbols.
Implementation and testing has been done using the USRP B210 and X310 SDRs, Intel Xeon CPU E5-2630 v3 CPU and Nvidia Tesla K40m GPU of ORBIT Testbed at WINLAB, Rutgers University.
A tutorial for using the files on the testbed will be posted shortly.
